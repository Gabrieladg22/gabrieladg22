## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gabriela Diaz

I'm an Environmental Engineering graduate with a background in program management, staffing, and quality control. While I started my career outside of tech, Iâ€™ve always had a passion for problem-solving and I discovered that coding allows me to tackle real-world challenges in a more dynamic and impactful way.

My passion for technology and efficiency led me to transition into software development and complete a coding bootcamp, where I built hands-on experience in:

- **Java**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Spring Boot** (RESTful APIs, unit testing)
- **HTML, CSS**

### ðŸ’¡ What I've Built
My favorite project is a **trading platform** that allows businesses to exchange surplus materials and calculates **carbon emissions saved** using an external API. It combines my technical skills with my sustainability background to create real-world impact.

---

### ðŸš€ I'm excited to:
- Apply my technical skills in a professional setting
- Contribute to meaningful projects
- Keep learning and growing as a developer

Feel free to check out my pinned projects or connect with me!
